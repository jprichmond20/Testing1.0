# Testing1.0
Run on emulator, no special steps required
App uses a button to randomly pick a programming language and if the switch is toggled to "on" then it will also randomize a concept for the user to work on in theory.
Overall, I was able to get the features working that I decided to research. Could improve by adding image/color changing ability to the app.
